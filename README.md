# Python Chat Server and Client Project
This is a demo of a very simplified chat server with IP connection. Created as a part of my university coursework. Multiple bugs and design errors still exist, but the core functionality can be demonstrated using this server. 

## **To use the server:**</br>
1. Run the **server.py** file and wait for "server active" message in the console.</br>
2. Run **client.py** file. Input the server's IP (Default 127.0.0.1) and choose your username. Connected IP's are logged in the server console. </br>
3. Have fun chatting!</br></br>

Important user functions (type into message input to use):</br></br>
/msg (username) (content) -- Sends a private message to another user</br>
/exit -- Exit the program
